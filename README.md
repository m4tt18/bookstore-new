This is a new version of an existing application named "me.dio.Bookstore" I developed during a bootcamp last year. 

Due to the lack of time, I ended posting the code incomplete so I took my time to sharpen my skills and developed a new and cleaner code I can be proud of.

In this version I used Lombok to make it easier and cleaner, leaving to Springboot to create Getters and Setters methods.
